# 📲 Wireless Digital Notice Board

Welcome to the Wireless Digital Notice Board System! 🖥️📲. This project uses the LPC2148 microcontroller to show scrolling messages on a 4-panel LED matrix. Messages are sent from a smartphone using Bluetooth 📱🔗 and saved in EEPROM 💾 so they stay even if the power goes off. It’s a simple, safe, and reliable way to share messages in schools 🎓, offices 🏢, or public places 🚌.

## 📋 Project Overview

This system combines multiple hardware modules to build a smart and interactive wireless display solution. Features include:

- 🖥️ **Scrolling Message Display** on a 4-panel 8×8 dot matrix LED  
- 📱 **Bluetooth Connectivity** via HC-05 module for wireless input  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** using AT24C256 EEPROM  
- 🔐 **Secure Updates** with passkey-protected messages (`@153Your Message$`)  
- 🔁 **Auto-Scrolling** stored messages until updated  
- 🧠 **Powered by LPC2148** microcontroller for fast and reliable control  

Ideal for campuses, offices, and public spaces needing dynamic, wireless communication.

## 🔧 Hardware Components

- **LPC2148 Microcontroller**  
  A 32-bit ARM7-based microcontroller that acts as the main controller, managing communication and display control.

- **4 × 8×8 Dot Matrix LED Displays**  
  Four 8x8 LED panels used to display scrolling text and animations.

- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**  
  Enables wireless serial communication between the microcontroller and a smartphone.

- **AT24C256 EEPROM**  
  An I²C-based memory chip for storing messages persistently, retaining data even when powered off.

- **74HC573 (Octal Latch)**  
  Holds data signals stable to control the LED matrix reliably.

- **74HC164 (Shift Register)**  
  Expands output pins to drive LED matrix rows or columns efficiently via serial data input.

## 💡 Features

- Send messages via Bluetooth using passkey format (e.g., `@153Message$`)  
- Scroll long messages across 4 LED matrices  
- Store and retrieve messages from EEPROM  
- Continuous display until new message arrives  
- Default message display if EEPROM is empty

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Keil uVision** for embedded C development  
- **Flash Magic** for programming LPC2148  
- Embedded C programming language

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. Flash the firmware onto LPC2148 using Flash Magic.  
2. Power on the board and pair your smartphone with the HC-05 module.  
3. Open a Bluetooth terminal app and send a message in the format:
   ```
   @153Hello World$
   ```
4. The system will:
   - Validate the passkey
   - Store the message in EEPROM
   - Scroll it on the LED display

## 🔧 Improvements & Future Enhancements

- **LCD Integration 📟**: While this project uses 8×8 dot matrix displays, it can be extended to work with an LCD (like 16x2 or graphical LCDs) for clearer, more flexible message display.   
- **Mobile App Interface 📱**: Create a simple Android app to send and manage messages easily over Bluetooth.  
- **Multi-Language Support 🌐**: Enhance character encoding to support local languages or symbols.  
- **Power Efficiency 💡**: Use LPC2148’s low-power modes to reduce energy consumption in idle states.  
- **Message Management 🗂️**: Implement EEPROM history to view or restore previously displayed messages.
